Create a plan for the following task:

<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

Important: focus on planning, do not write any code. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the task and identify core requirements
2. Inspect all files that are relevant for the task
3. Ask clarifying questions about the task and codebase
4. Propose a plan and identify 1-5 steps depending on complexity
5. Iteratively ask for my feedback on the plan until I approve it
6. Verify that the plan does NOT contain any code
7. Save the plan as `workspace/[task-name]/implementation-plan.md` or use a path I provide.
