# Dependency Management Guide

To add a dependency to the project, run the following command:

```bash
uv add <dependency>
```

To remove a dependency from the project, run the following command:

```bash
uv remove <dependency>
```

Add optional arguments like `--dev` for development dependencies, for example, as needed.

For syncing dependencies after a manual change of `pyproject.toml`, run the following command:

```bash
uv sync
```
