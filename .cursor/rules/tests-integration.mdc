# Integration Tests Guidelines

Integration tests in this project:

- Should follow general guidelines in @tests-general.mdc
- Should be placed in `tests/integration/` directory
- Test how multiple components work together

## MCP Integration Testing
- For testing MCP (Model Context Protocol) features, use the test server in `tests/mcp_server.py`
- Test error handling and edge cases in MCP interactions

## Running
- `pytest -xsv tests/integration` for running all integration tests
- `pytest -xsv tests/integration --cov=ipybox --cov-report=term` for running all integration tests and generating a coverage report
- `pytest -xsv tests/integration/test_[name].py` for running a single integration test file
- `pytest -xsv tests/integration/test_[name].py::[test-name]` for running a single integration test
