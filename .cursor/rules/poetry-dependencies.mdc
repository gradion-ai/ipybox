# Poetry Dependencies Guide

To add a dependency to the project, run the following command:

```bash
poetry add <dependency>
```

To remove a dependency from the project, run the following command:

```bash
poetry remove <dependency>
```

Add optional arguments like `--group`, for example, as needed.
