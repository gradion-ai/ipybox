# Project Setup Guide

Create a new Conda environment and activate it:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n gradion-ipybox
conda activate gradion-ipybox
```

Install dependencies with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install --with docs
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
invoke precommit-install
```

Enforce coding conventions (also enforced by pre-commit hooks):

```bash
invoke cc
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest -s tests
```
