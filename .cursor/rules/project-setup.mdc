# Project Setup Guide

Install dependencies and create virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
invoke precommit-install
```

Enforce coding conventions (also enforced by pre-commit hooks):

```bash
invoke cc
```

Run tests:

```bash
invoke test
```
