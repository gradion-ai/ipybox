# Unit Tests Guidelines

Unit tests in this project:

- Should follow general guidelines in @tests-general.mdc
- Should be placed in `tests/unit/` directory
- Should focus on testing a single component or function in isolation
- Should mock dependencies to isolate the unit under test
- Should be fast and not depend on external services or databases

## Test Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names that indicate what's being tested
- Format: `test_<method_name>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`
- Example: `test_calculate_total_with_discount_returns_reduced_price`

## Running
- `pytest -xsv tests/unit` for running unit tests
- `pytest -xsv tests/unit --cov=ipybox --cov-report=term` for running unit tests and generating a coverage report
