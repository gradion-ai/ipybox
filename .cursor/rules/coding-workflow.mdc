# Coding workflow

1. Analyse the task
2. Inspect files that are relevant for the tasks
3. Ask clarifying questions to the user
4. Create an implementation plan but to not write code yet
5. Discuss the plan with the user until the user confirms your plan
6. Save the plan to a file if the user requests that
7. Implement the full or part of the plan, depending on the user's feedback
