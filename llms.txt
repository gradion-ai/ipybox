# ipybox

> ipybox

ipybox is a Python code execution sandbox with first-class support for programmatic MCP tool calling.
It generates typed Python tool APIs from MCP server tool schemas, supporting both local stdio and
remote HTTP servers.

Code that calls the generated API executes in a sandboxed IPython kernel. The API delegates MCP tool
execution to a separate environment that enforces tool call approval, requiring applications to accept
or reject each tool call.

ipybox is designed for agents that act by executing Python code rather than issuing JSON tool calls.
This code action approach enables tool composition and intermediate result processing in a single
inference pass, keeping intermediate results out of the agent's context window.
